# Finishing a Development Branch

## Overview

Guide completion of development work by presenting clear options and handling chosen workflow.

**Core principle:** Verify tests → Present options → Execute choice → Clean up.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."

## The Process

### Step 1: Verify Tests

**Before presenting options, verify tests pass:**

```bash
# Run project's test suite
npm test / cargo test / pytest / go test ./...
```

**If tests fail:**
```
Tests failing (<N> failures). Must fix before completing:

[Show failures]

Cannot proceed with merge/PR until tests pass.
```

Stop. Don't proceed to Step 2.

**If tests pass:** Continue to Step 2.

### Step 2: Determine Base Branch

```bash
# Try common base branches
git merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD master 2>/dev/null
```

Or ask: "This branch split from main - is that correct?"

### Step 3: Present Options

Present exactly these 4 options:

```
Implementation complete. What would you like to do?

1. Merge locally - Merge to <base> and stay here
2. Create PR - Push branch and create pull request
3. Keep as-is - Leave branch for manual handling
4. Discard - Delete branch and all changes
```

Wait for user choice. Do not proceed without explicit selection.

### Step 4: Execute Choice

**Option 1 - Merge Locally:**
```bash
git checkout <base>
git merge <feature-branch>
git branch -d <feature-branch>
```

**Option 2 - Create PR:**
```bash
git push -u origin <feature-branch>
# Create PR via gh or API
```

**Option 3 - Keep As-Is:**
Just confirm and exit.

**Option 4 - Discard:**
```
Type 'discard' to confirm deletion of all work on this branch:
```
Then:
```bash
git checkout <base>
git branch -D <feature-branch>
```

### Step 5: Worktree Cleanup

**For Options 1 and 4:** Check if in worktree:
```bash
git worktree list | grep $(git branch --show-current)
```

If yes:
```bash
git worktree remove <worktree-path>
```

**For Option 3:** Keep worktree.

## Quick Reference

| Option | Merge | Push | Keep Worktree | Cleanup Branch |
|--------|-------|------|---------------|----------------|
| 1. Merge locally | ✓ | - | - | ✓ |
| 2. Create PR | - | ✓ | ✓ | - |
| 3. Keep as-is | - | - | ✓ | - |
| 4. Discard | - | - | - | ✓ (force) |

## Integration with Archive

**For Option 1 (Merge Locally):**
After successful merge, prompt:
```
Would you like to archive this change? Run /archive <change-name>
```

This triggers the archive workflow to save metadata and create Git tags.

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Proceed with failing tests
- Merge without verifying tests on result
- Delete work without confirmation
- Force-push without explicit request

**Always:**
- Verify tests before offering options
- Present exactly 4 options
- Get typed confirmation for Option 4
- Clean up worktree for Options 1 & 4 only

## Integration

**Called by:**
- **subagent-driven-development** (Step 7) - After all tasks complete
- **executing-plans** (Step 5) - After all batches complete

**Pairs with:**
- **using-git-worktrees** - Cleans up worktree created by that skill

## 下一步

完成后：

**REQUIRED:** 运行 `/archive {change-name}` 归档变更

调用 `superpowers:archiving-changes` 完成归档流程。
