# Dispatching Parallel Agents

## Overview

When you have multiple unrelated failures (different test files, different subsystems, different bugs), investigating them sequentially wastes time. Each investigation is independent and can happen in parallel.

**Core principle:** Dispatch one agent per independent problem domain. Let them work concurrently.

## When to Use

**Use when:**
- 3+ test files failing with different root causes
- Multiple independent bugs in different subsystems
- Research tasks (API exploration) that don't affect each other
- Code reviews of unrelated modules

**Don't use when:**
- Failures share a common cause
- Tasks have sequential dependencies
- Shared state requires coordination

## Dispatch Template

For each independent problem:

```
[Dispatch Agent N]
Problem: {specific problem domain}
Scope: {files/tests to investigate}
Goal: {expected outcome - fix/diagnosis/research}
```

## Example: Multiple Test Failures

Scenario: 6 failures across 3 files after major refactoring

**Failures:**
- agent-tool-abort.test.ts: 3 failures (timing issues)
- batch-completion-behavior.test.ts: 2 failures (tools not executing)
- tool-approval-race-conditions.test.ts: 1 failure (execution count = 0)

**Decision:** Independent domains - abort logic separate from batch completion separate from race conditions

**Dispatch:**
```
Agent 1 → Fix agent-tool-abort.test.ts
Agent 2 → Fix batch-completion-behavior.test.ts
Agent 3 → Fix tool-approval-race-conditions.test.ts
```

**Results:**
- Agent 1: Replaced timeouts with event-based waiting
- Agent 2: Fixed event structure bug (threadId in wrong place)
- Agent 3: Added wait for async tool execution to complete

**Integration:** All fixes independent, no conflicts, full suite green

**Time saved:** 3 problems solved in parallel vs sequentially

## Key Benefits

1. **Parallelization** - Multiple investigations happen simultaneously
2. **Focus** - Each agent has narrow scope, less context to track
3. **Independence** - Agents don't interfere with each other
4. **Speed** - 3 problems solved in time of 1

## Verification

After agents return:
1. **Review each summary** - Understand what changed
2. **Check for conflicts** - Did agents edit same code?
3. **Run full suite** - Verify all fixes work together
4. **Spot check** - Agents can make systematic errors

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Dispatch without confirming independence
- Skip verification after agents return
- Assume no conflicts

**Always:**
- Verify tasks are truly independent
- Review all agent summaries
- Run full test suite after integration
